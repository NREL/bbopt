    Every iteration of the algorithm sequentially chooses a number from 0 to

    * Inf-step (0): Selects a sample point that minimizes the
      :math:`\\mu` measure, i.e., :meth:`mu_measure()`. The point selected is
      the farthest from the current sample using the kernel measure.

    * Global search (1 to :attr:`cycleLength`): Minimizes the product of
      :math:`\\mu` measure by the distance to a target value. The target value
      is based on the distance to the current minimum of the surrogate. The
      described measure is known as the 'bumpiness measure'.

    * Local search (:attr:`cycleLength` + 1): Minimizes the bumpiness measure with
      a target value equal to the current minimum of the surrogate. If the
      current minimum is already represented by the training points of the
      surrogate, do a global search with a target value slightly smaller than
      the current minimum.

    After each sample point is chosen we verify how close it is from the current
    sample. If it is too close, we replace it by a random point in the domain
    drawn from an uniform distribution. This is strategy was proposed in [#]_.

        notes that :math:`g_y(x)` tends to infinity

        use :math:`-1/g_y(x)` for the minimization problem. Björkman and

        slow down convergence rates for :math:`g_y(x)` in `[0,1]` since it
